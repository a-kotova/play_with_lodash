As soon as 'lodash' ready, lets do some general stuff

1. Setup eslint and configure it to use 'airbnb-base' config
2. Rework functions to be arrow functions
3. Create helpers to methods which are in common use across your tasks
4. Change tasks numeration to be correct against task files :)
5. Update methods for their length not to exceed suggested line length
